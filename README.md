An Adventure-esque, text-based game
Written in python 2.7.x

### ToDo

This was an initial proof of concept. It was only half thought out and not fully implemented. 

* Create more rooms
    * there are only three _playable_ rooms, there should be a few more.
* At the moment, there is only one enemy, even thogh there are classes for more enemies.
