# Dragon's Lair Adventure
An Adventure-esque, text-based game
Written in python 2.7.x

As a side note, I did this as part of a [great introductory python course](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) by [Zed Shaw](http://zedshaw.com/)!

The initial file `textBasedAdventureGame.py` was working as a very, very basic game after two days... (I think that's not too bad.) I've left it in the current code base just to see what has happened.

### ToDo

This was an initial proof of concept. It was only half thought out and not fully implemented. 

* Create more rooms
    * there are only three _playable_ rooms, there should be a few more.
* At the moment, there is only one enemy, even thogh there are classes for more enemies.
